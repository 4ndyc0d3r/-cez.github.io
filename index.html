			<h1><i>Dear Cindi</i></h1>
			<h3><i>I want you to know how much I love you, and how much I care about you. Why you? well why not. I know I have
said this a lot but I will keep saying this just incase you happen to forget, but I wouldn't want anyone else
but you. I swear you are a dream come true. Everytime I look at you I just get lost in the moment. You make me
forget where we are at, you make me forget about the past, and about everything that is going on around us. 
You are like music..my own escape. Everytime we hangout weather it's at a coffee shop, mall, beach, or even doing
laundry it still a perfect date. You are my night shiney star throughout my darkest days. You are the sun 
rise to my every morning.<br /> The expresso to my coffee(: <3 You inspires me, motivate me. I swear if it wasn't
for you I wouldn't know where I would be. So much emotion when I hold you hand, and walk with you, so much happiness when I lean
							 over and kiss you. I never been so happy before, you make it so easy to 
							 love and trust baby. You are the definition of true love<3 <br />
				I want to be your knight and shiney amor, I want to be your shadow when you feel alone,
				i want to be the shoulder when ever you feel like crying, I want to be the reason for your smile,
				and I want to be your bestfriend when you are going throught ups and down. I will always 
				love you Cindi always and forever<3 till death comes. My ride and die(:
